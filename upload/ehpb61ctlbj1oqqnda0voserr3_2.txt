Description: A barebones remake of the Game and Watch game Judge. If your number is bigger than or equal to the enemy on the right hit the A button to whack him with your hammer. If it is smaller hit B to dodge. Hits are worth three points and dodges are worth two. If you hit the wrong button the enemy gets the points. First one to ninety nine points wins.
